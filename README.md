# Scripts
Repository to hold simple scripts not deserving of their own repo.  Most of what I do in python, for the time being, is primarily related to systems tasks, automation, and sometimes "back of the napkin" calculation-type stuff.

I have also been playing around with CS book style brainteasers, the products of which I will post in here just for fun and for future reference.

## Brainteasers:
This folder houses puzzle solutions for various problems I've found on the net.

## Work:
This folder houses some old work-related scripts, mostly file processing and system automation stuff

### moveCDMUsers.py:

This is a simple script that I created to help with a somewhat tedious task on one of our repository systems.  Often enough with this application, it is easier to create a new updated instance than it is to try and updte it inline.  Thus I have written scripts like this one to transfer users created in a sort of archaic way - from one system to another.  Warning!!!  This is dirty and was only done after exhausting all other resources for automation.


### suckdump.py

A silly little script that was one of my first tries playing with python.  Its primary job was to take a huge old-school system administration documentation system (text files, loosely organized on a central filesystem) and convert them, heirarchy and all to a Python based wiki system.  It also did the inverse of the process mentioned above for people that had their own special ways of sifting through information and didnt want a web browser to get in the way.  This script isnt pretty, it isnt flashy, and it doesnt do anything fancy, but it shows the general kind of stuff I did using python.
