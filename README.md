# Scripts
Repository to hold simple scripts not deserving of their own repo

moveCDMUsers.py:

This is a simple script that I created to help with a somewhat tedious task on one of our repository systems.  Often enough with this application, it is easier to create a new updated instance than it is to try and updte it inline.  Thus I have written scripts like this one to transfer users created in a sort of archaic way - from one system to another.  Warning!!!  This is dirty and was only done after exhausting all other resources for automation.
